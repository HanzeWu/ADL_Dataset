# ADL_Dataset
The Dataset we used is the Dataset for ADL Recognition with Wrist-worn Accelerometer is a public collection of labelled accelerometer data recordings to be used for the creation and validation of acceleration models of simple ADL.

The Dataset is composed of the recordings of 14 simple ADL (brush_teeth, climb_stairs, comb_hair, descend_stairs, drink_glass, eat_meat, eat_soup, getup_bed, liedown_bed, pour_water, sitdown_chair, standup_chair, use_telephone, walk) perfomed by a total of 16 volunteers.
